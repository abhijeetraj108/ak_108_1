# RFID BASED ATTENDENCE SYSTEM USING ARDUINO

An RFID based attendance system using Arduino is a system that uses radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to automate the process of taking attendance. The system consists of an RFID reader, RFID tags, a microcontroller, and a computer program.


Here's how the system works:
1. Each student or employee is given an RFID tag that contains a unique identification number.
2. The RFID reader is installed at the entrance of the classroom or office.
3. When a student or employee enters the room, they must scan their RFID tag using the reader.
4. The reader reads the unique ID of the tag and sends it to the microcontroller.
5. The microcontroller processes the data and sends it to the computer program.
6. The computer program stores the data in a database and marks the attendance of the student or employee.

## ADVANTAGES

The advantages of using an RFID based attendance system are:
1. It eliminates the need for manual attendance taking, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.
2. It provides real-time attendance data, which can be used for monitoring student or employee attendance and for generating reports.
3. It is a more secure and reliable method of attendance taking, as RFID tags cannot be easily duplicated or tampered with.
4. It is a cost-effective solution, as RFID tags are inexpensive and can be reused.

To implement an RFID based attendance system using Arduino, you will need the following components:
1. Arduino board
2. RFID reader module
3. RFID tags
4. Connecting wires
5. Breadboard
6. Computer with Arduino IDE software installed

RFID tags are small, passive devices that contain a unique identifier.

RFID readers emit radio waves that power the tags and allow them to be read.

RFID readers can be used to track the movement of people or objects within a defined area.

RFID-based attendance systems can be used to track employee or student attendance, as well as to track the movement of people or objects within a building or campus.

RFID-based attendance systems are more efficient and accurate than traditional paper-based attendance systems.
